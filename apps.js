// 1. Play Function
    //--playerChoice
// 2.

// The function should accept a single argument that represent the players choice: "rock" "paper" or "scissors".

// ### Determine a Winner!

// We are now going to add logic to the `play function` that will determine who wins the game.
// This will require a you to use `if` `else` statements.

// **TIP:** Before writing code, it may be beneficial to write down on a scrap of paper the logic that will be used
// to determine a winner. Writing in plain english before writing in code is a good idea!!!
